Please reuse the data in project: https://github.com/oywtece/dstn.

Although the data are prepared for the DSTN model, we can use the part of the label and the target ad for the DeepMP model.

Please put the "day_1.csv", "day_2.csv" ... files under this "data" folder.

The config_deepmcp.py file has been updated such that you can run "dnn.py" and "deepmp.py" successfully.

You can check https://github.com/oywtece/dstn/issues/4 for the meaning of the columns in the csv data files.
