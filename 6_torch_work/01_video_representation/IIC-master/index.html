    <h2 class="w3-wide">Abstract</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">We propose a self-supervised method to learn feature representations
    from videos.Astandard approach in traditional self-supervised
    methods uses positive-negative data pairs to train with contrastive
    learning strategy. In such a case, different modalities of the same
    video are treated as positives and video clips from a different video
    are treated as negatives. Because the spatio-temporal information is
    important for video representation, we extend the negative samples
    by introducing intra-negative samples, which are transformed from
    the same anchor video by breaking temporal relations in video
    clips. With the proposed inter-intra contrastive framework, we
    can train spatio-temporal convolutional networks to learn video
    representations. There are many flexible options in our proposed
    framework and we conduct experiments by using several different
    configurations. Evaluations are conducted on video retrieval and
    video recognition tasks using the learned video representation. Our
    proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art results by a
    large margin, such as 16.7% and 9.5% points improvements in top-
    1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video retrieval,
    respectively. For video recognition, improvements can also be obtained
    on these two benchmark datasets.</p>
